<h2>By LESTER DEL REY</h2>

<div class="center"><big><b>Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS</b></big></div>

<div class="bk1"><p><i><big><b>There was nothing, especially
on Earth, which could set him
free&mdash;the truth least of all!</b></big></i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dane Phillips</span> slouched
in the window seat, watching
the morning crowds
on their way to work and carefully
avoiding any attempt to
read Jordan's old face as the
editor skimmed through the notes.
He had learned to make his tall,
bony body seem all loose-jointed
relaxation, no matter what he
felt. But the oversized hands in
his pockets were clenched so
tightly that the nails were cutting
into his palms.</p>

<p>Every tick of the old-fashioned
clock sent a throb racing through
his brain. Every rustle of the
pages seemed to release a fresh
shot of adrenalin into his blood
stream. <i>This time</i>, his mind was
pleading. <i>It has to be right this
time....</i></p>

<p>Jordan finished his reading and
shoved the folder back. He
reached for his pipe, sighed, and
then nodded slowly. "A nice job
of researching, Phillips. And it
might make a good feature for
the Sunday section, at that."</p>

<p>It took a second to realize that
the words meant acceptance, for
Phillips had prepared himself too
thoroughly against another failure.
Now he felt the tautened
muscles release, so quickly that
he would have fallen if he hadn't
been braced against the seat.</p>

<p>He groped in his mind, hunting
for words, and finding none.
There was only the hot, sudden
flame of unbelieving hope. And
then an almost blinding exultation.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jordan</span> didn't seem to notice
his silence. The editor made a
neat pile of the notes, nodding
again. "Sure. I like it. We've been
short of shock stuff lately and
the readers go for it when we
can get a fresh angle. But naturally
you'd have to leave out
all that nonsense on Blanding.
Hell, the man's just buried, and
his relatives and friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that's the proof!" Phillips
stared at the editor, trying to
penetrate through the haze of
hope that had somehow grown
chilled and unreal. His thoughts
were abruptly disorganized and
out of his control. Only the urgency
remained. "It's the key
evidence. And we've got to move
fast! I don't know how long it
takes, but even one more day
may be too late!"</p>

<p>Jordan nearly dropped the pipe
from his lips as he jerked upright
to peer sharply at the
younger man. "Are you crazy? Do
you seriously expect me to get
an order to exhume him now?
What would it get us, other than
lawsuits? Even if we could get
the order without cause&mdash;which
we can't!"</p>

<p>Then the pipe did fall as he
gaped open-mouthed. "My God,
you believe all that stuff. You
expected us to publish it <i>straight</i>!"</p>

<p>"No," Dane said thickly. The
hope was gone now, as if it had
never existed, leaving a numb
emptiness where nothing mattered.
"No, I guess I didn't really
expect anything. But I believe
the facts. Why shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>He reached for the papers with
hands he could hardly control
and began stuffing them back
into the folder. All the careful
documentation, the fingerprints&mdash;smudged,
perhaps, in some cases,
but still evidence enough for anyone
but a fool&mdash;</p>

<p>"Phillips?" Jordan said questioningly
to himself, and then his
voice was taking on a new edge.
"Phillips! Wait a minute, I've got
it now! <i>Dane</i> Phillips, not <i>Arthur</i>!
Two years on the <i>Trib.</i> Then you
turned up on the <i>Register</i> in Seattle?
Phillip Dean, or some such
name there."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Dane agreed. There
was no use in denying anything
now. "Yeah, Dane Arthur Phillips.
So I suppose I'm through
here?"</p>

<p>Jordan nodded again and there
was a faint look of fear in his
expression. "You can pick up your
pay on the way out. And make
it quick, before I change my mind
and call the boys in white!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> could have been worse. It had
been worse before. And there
was enough in the pay envelope
to buy what he needed&mdash;a flash
camera, a little folding shovel
from one of the surplus houses,
and a bottle of good scotch. It
would be dark enough for him to
taxi out to Oakhaven Cemetery,
where Blanding had been buried.</p>

<p>It wouldn't change the minds
of the fools, of course. Even if
he could drag back what he might
find, without the change being
completed, they wouldn't accept
the evidence. He'd been crazy to
think anything could change their
minds. And they called <i>him</i> a
fanatic! If the facts he'd dug up
in ten years of hunting wouldn't
convince them, nothing would.
And yet he had to see for himself,
before it was too late!</p>

<p>He picked a cheap hotel at
random and checked in under an
assumed name. He couldn't go
back to his room while there was
a chance that Jordan still might
try to turn him in. There wouldn't
be time for Sylvia's detectives to
bother him, probably, but there
was the ever-present danger that
one of the aliens might intercept
the message.</p>

<p>He shivered. He'd been risking
that for ten years, yet the likelihood
was still a horror to him.
The uncertainty made it harder
to take than any human-devised
torture could be. There was no
way of guessing what an alien
might do to anyone who discovered
that all men were not
human&mdash;that some were ...
zombies.</p>

<p>There was the classic syllogism:
<i>All men are mortal; I am
a man; therefore, I am mortal.</i>
But not Blanding&mdash;or Corporal
Harding.</p>

<p>It was Harding's "death" that
had started it all during the fighting
on Guadalcanal. A grenade
had come flying into the foxhole
where Dane and Harding had felt
reasonably safe. The concussion
had knocked Dane out, possibly
saving his life when the enemy
thought he was dead. He'd come
to in the daylight to see Harding
lying there, mangled and twisted,
with his throat torn. There was
blood on Dane's uniform, obviously
spattered from the dead
man. It hadn't been a mistake or
delusion; Harding had been dead.</p>

<p>It had taken Dane two days
of crawling and hiding to get
back to his group, too exhausted
to report Harding's death. He'd
slept for twenty hours. And when
he awoke, Harding had been
standing beside him, with a whole
throat and a fresh uniform, grinning
and kidding him for running
off and leaving a stunned friend
behind.</p>

<p>It was no ringer, but Harding
himself, complete to the smallest
personal memories and personality
traits.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> pressures of war
probably saved Dane's sanity
while he learned to face the facts.
All men are mortal; Harding is
not mortal; therefore, Harding is
not a man! Nor was Harding
alone&mdash;Dane found enough evidence
to know there were others.</p>

<p>The <i>Tribune</i> morgue yielded
even more data. A man had faced
seven firing squads and walked
away. Another survived over a
dozen attacks by professional killers.
Fingerprints turned up mysteriously
"copied" from those of
men long dead. Some of the aliens
seemed to heal almost instantly;
others took days. Some operated
completely alone; some seemed
to have joined with others. But
they were legion.</p>

<p>Lack of a clearer pattern of
attack made him consider the
possibility of human mutation,
but such tissue was too wildly
different, and the invasion had
begun long before atomics or X-rays.
He gave up trying to understand
their alien motivations. It
was enough that they existed in
secret, slowly growing in numbers
while mankind was unaware of
them.</p>

<p>When his proof was complete
and irrefutable, he took it to his
editor&mdash;to be fired, politely but
coldly. Other editors were less
polite. But he went on doggedly
trying and failing. What else
could he do? Somehow, he had to
find the few people who could
recognize facts and warn them.
The aliens would get him, of
course, when the story broke, but
a warned humanity could cope
with them. <i>Ye shall know the
truth, and the truth shall make
you free.</i></p>

<p>Then he met Sylvia by accident
after losing his fifth job&mdash;a girl
who had inherited a fortune big
enough to spread his message in
paid ads across the country. They
were married before he found she
was hard-headed about her money.
She demanded a full explanation
for every cent beyond his allowance.
In the end, she got the explanation.
And while he was trying
to cash the check she gave
him, she visited Dr. Buehl, to
come back with a squad of quiet,
refined strong-arm boys who made
sure Dane reached Buehl's "rest
home" safely.</p>

<p>Hydrotherapy ... Buehl as the
kindly firm father image ... analysis
... hypnosis that stripped
every secret from him, including
his worst childhood nightmare.</p>

<p>His father had committed a
violent, bloody suicide after one
of the many quarrels with Dane's
mother. Dane had found the body.</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="356" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Two nights after the funeral,
he had dreamed of his father's
face, horror-filled, at the window.
He knew now that it was a normal
nightmare, caused by being
forced to look at the face in the
coffin, but the shock had lasted
for years. It had bothered him
again, after his discovery of the
aliens, until a thorough check had
proved without doubt that his
father had been fully human,
with a human, if tempestuous,
childhood behind him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dr. Buehl</span> was delighted.
"You see, Dane? You <i>know</i>
it was a nightmare, but you don't
really believe it even now. Your
father was an alien monster to
you&mdash;no adult is quite human
to a child. And that literal-minded
self, your subconscious, saw him
after he died. So there are alien
monsters who return from death.
Then you come to from a concussion.
Harding is sprawled out unconscious,
covered with blood&mdash;probably
your blood, since you
say he wasn't wounded, later.</p>

<p>"But after seeing your father,
you can't associate blood with
yourself&mdash;you see it as a horrible
wound on Harding. When he
turns out to be alive, you're still
in partial shock, with your subconscious
dominant. And that has
the answer already. There are
monsters who come back from the
dead! An exaggerated reaction,
but nothing really abnormal. We'll
have you out of here in no time."</p>

<p>No non-directive psychiatry for
Buehl. The man beamed paternally,
chuckling as he added what
he must have considered the
clincher. "Anyhow, even zombies
can't stand fire, Dane, so you can
stop worrying about Harding. I
checked up on him. He was
burned to a crisp in a hotel fire
two months ago."</p>

<p>It was logical enough to shake
Dane's faith, until he came across
Milo Blanding's picture in a magazine
article on society in St.
Louis. According to the item,
Milo was a cousin of <i>the</i> Blandings,
whose father had vanished
in Chile as a young man, and
who had just rejoined the family.
The picture was of Harding!</p>

<p>An alien could have gotten
away by simply committing suicide
and being carried from the
rest home, but Dane had to do
it the hard way, watching his
chance and using commando tactics
on a guard who had come to
accept him as a harmless nut.</p>

<p>In St. Louis, he'd used the "Purloined
Letter" technique to hide&mdash;going
back to newspaper work
and using almost his real name.
It had seemed to work, too. But
he'd been less lucky about Harding-Blanding.
The man had been
in Europe on some kind of a tour
until his return only this last
week.</p>

<p>Dane had seen him just once
then&mdash;but long enough to be
sure it was Harding&mdash;before he
died again.</p>

<p>This time, it was in a drunken
auto accident that seemed to be
none of his fault, but left his body
a mangled wreck.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was almost dark when
Dane dismissed the taxi at the
false address, a mile from the
entrance to the cemetery. He
watched it turn back down the
road, then picked up the valise
with his camera and folding
shovel. He shivered as he moved
reluctantly ahead. War had
proved that he would never be a
brave man and the old fears of
darkness and graveyards were
still strong in him. But he had to
know what the coffin contained
now, if it wasn't already too late.</p>

<p>It represented the missing link
in his picture of the aliens. What
happened to them during the
period of regrowth? Did they revert
to their natural form? Were
they at all conscious while the
body reshaped itself into wholeness?
Dane had puzzled over it
night after night, with no answer.</p>

<p>Nor could he figure how they
could escape from the grave. Perhaps
a man could force his way
out of some of the coffins he had
inspected. The soil would still be
soft and loose in the grave and
a lot of the coffins and the boxes
around them were strong in appearance
only. A determined
creature that could exist without
much air for long enough might
make it. But there were other
caskets that couldn't be cracked,
at least without the aid of outside
help.</p>

<p>What happened when a creature
that could survive even the
poison of embalming fluids and
the draining of all the blood
woke up in such a coffin? Dane's
mind skittered from it, as always,
and then came back to it reluctantly.</p>

<p>There were still accounts of
corpses turned up with the nails
and hair grown long in the grave.
Could normal tissues stand the
current tricks of the morticians
to have life enough for such
growth? The possibility was absurd.
Those cases had to be aliens&mdash;ones
who hadn't escaped. Even
they must die eventually in such
a case&mdash;after weeks and months!
It took time for hair to grow.</p>

<p>And there were stories of
corpses that had apparently
fought and twisted in their coffins
still. What was it like for an alien
then, going slowly mad while it
waited for true death? How long
did madness take?</p>

<p>He shivered again, but went
steadily on while the cemetery
fence appeared in the distance.
He'd seen Blanding's coffin&mdash;and
the big, solid metal casket
around it that couldn't be cracked
by any amount of effort and
strength. He was sure the creature
was still there, unless it had a
confederate. But that wouldn't
matter. An empty coffin would
also be proof.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dane</span> avoided the main
gate, unsure about whether
there would be a watchman or
not. A hundred feet away, there
was a tree near the ornamental
spikes of the iron fence. He threw
his bag over and began shinnying
up. It was difficult, but he made
it finally, dropping onto the soft
grass beyond. There was the trace
of the Moon at times through the
clouds, but it hadn't betrayed
him, and there had been no alarm
wire along the top of the fence.</p>

<p>He moved from shadow to
shadow, his hair prickling along
the base of his neck. Locating the
right grave in the darkness was
harder than he had expected,
even with an occasional brief use
of the small flashlight. But at
last he found the marker that
was serving until the regular monument
could arrive.</p>

<p>His hands were sweating so
much that it was hard to use the
small shovel, but the digging of
foxholes had given him experience
and the ground was still soft
from the gravediggers' work. He
stopped once, as the Moon came
out briefly. Again, a sound in the
darkness above left him hovering
and sick in the hole. But it must
have been only some animal.</p>

<p>He uncovered the top of the
casket with hands already blistering.</p>

<p>Then he cursed as he realized
the catches were near the bottom,
making his work even harder.</p>

<p>He reached them at last, fumbling
them open. The metal top
of the casket seemed to be a
dome of solid lead, and he had no
room to maneuver, but it began
swinging up reluctantly, until he
could feel the polished wood of
the coffin.</p>

<p>Dane reached for the lid with
hands he could barely control.
Fear was thick in his throat now.
What could an alien do to a man
who discovered it? Would it be
Harding there&mdash;or some monstrous
thing still changing? How
long did it take a revived monster
to go mad when it found no
way to escape?</p>

<p>He gripped the shovel in one
hand, working at the lid with the
other. Now, abruptly, his nerves
steadied, as they had done whenever
he was in real battle. He
swung the lid up and began groping
for the camera.</p>

<p>His hand went into the silk-lined
interior and found nothing!
He was too late. Either Harding
had gotten out somehow before
the final ceremony or a confederate
had already been here. The
coffin was empty.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> were no warning
sounds this time&mdash;only hands
that slipped under his arms and
across his mouth, lifting him
easily from the grave. A match
flared briefly and he was looking
into the face of Buehl's chief
strong-arm man.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Phillips. Promise
to be quiet and we'll release you.
Okay?" At Dane's sickened nod,
he gestured to the others. "Let
him go. And, Tom, better get
that filled in. We don't want any
trouble from this."</p>

<p>Surprise came from the grave
a moment later. "Hey, Burke,
there's no corpse here!"</p>

<p>Burke's words killed any hopes
Dane had at once. "So what?
Ever hear of cremation? Lots
of people use a regular coffin for
the ashes."</p>

<p>"He wasn't cremated," Dane
told him. "You can check up on
that." But he knew it was useless.</p>

<p>"Sure, Mr. Phillips. We'll do
that." The tone was one reserved
for humoring madmen. Burke
turned, gesturing. "Better come
along, Mr. Phillips. Your wife
and Dr. Buehl are waiting at the
hotel."</p>

<p>The gate was open now, but
there was no sign of a watchman;
if one worked here, Sylvia's
money would have taken care of
that, of course. Dane went along
quietly, sitting in the rubble of
his hopes while the big car purred
through the morning and on
down Lindell Boulevard toward
the hotel. Once he shivered, and
Burke dug out hot brandied coffee.
They had thought of everything,
including a coat to cover
his dirt-soiled clothes as they took
him up the elevator to where
Buehl and Sylvia were waiting
for him.</p>

<p>She had been crying, obviously,
but there were no tears or recriminations
when she came over
to kiss him. Funny, she must still
love him&mdash;as he'd learned to his
surprise he loved her. Under different
circumstances ...</p>

<p>"So you found me?" he asked
needlessly of Buehl. He was operating
on purely automatic
habits now, the reaction from the
night and his failure numbing
him emotionally. "Jordan got in
touch with you?"</p>

<p>Buehl smiled back at him. "We
knew where you were all along,
Dane. But as long as you acted
normal, we hoped it might be
better than the home. Too bad
we couldn't stop you before you
got all mixed up in this."</p>

<p>"So I suppose I'm committed
to your booby-hatch again?"</p>

<p>Buehl nodded, refusing to resent
the term. "I'm afraid so,
Dane&mdash;for a while, anyhow.
You'll find your clothes in that
room. Why don't you clean up a
little? Take a hot bath, maybe.
You'll feel better."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dane</span> went in, surprised when
no guards followed him. But
they had thought of everything.
What looked like a screen on the
window had been recently installed
and it was strong enough
to prevent his escape. Blessed
are the poor, for they shall be
poorly guarded!</p>

<p>He was turning on the shower
when he heard the sound of
voices coming through the door.
He left the water running and
came back to listen. Sylvia was
speaking.</p>

<p>"&mdash;seems so logical, so completely
rational."</p>

<p>"It makes him a dangerous person,"
Buehl answered, and there
was no false warmth in his voice
now. "Sylvia, you've got to admit
it to yourself. All the reason and
analysis in the world won't convince
him he's wrong. This time
we'll have to use shock treatment.
Burn over those memories, fade
them out. It's the only possible
course."</p>

<p>There was a pause and then a
sigh. "I suppose you're right."</p>

<p>Dane didn't wait to hear more.
He drew back, while his mind
fought to accept the hideous reality.
Shock treatment! The
works, if what he knew of psychiatry
was correct. Enough of it
to erase his memories&mdash;a part
of himself. It wasn't therapy
Buehl was considering; it couldn't
be.</p>

<p>It was the answer of an alien
that had a human in its hands&mdash;one
who knew too much!</p>

<p>He might have guessed. What
better place for an alien than in
the guise of a psychiatrist? Where
else was there the chance for all
the refined, modern torture
needed to burn out a man's mind?
Dane had spent ten years in fear
of being discovered by them&mdash;and
now Buehl had him.</p>

<p>Sylvia? He couldn't be sure.
Probably she was human. It
wouldn't make any difference.
There was nothing he could do
through her. Either she was part
of the game or she really thought
him mad.</p>

<p>Dane tried the window again,
but it was hopeless. There would
be no escape this time. Buehl
couldn't risk it. The shock treatment&mdash;or
whatever Buehl would
use under the name of shock
treatment&mdash;would begin at once.
It would be easy to slip, to use an
overdose of something, to make
sure Dane was killed. Or there
were ways of making sure it
didn't matter. They could leave
him alive, but take his mind away.</p>

<p>In alien hands, human psychiatry
could do worse than all the
medieval torture chambers!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> sickness grew in his
stomach as he considered the
worst that could happen. Death
he could accept, if he had to. He
could even face the chance of
torture by itself, as he had accepted
the danger while trying to
have his facts published. But to
have his mind taken from him, a
step at a time&mdash;to watch his
personality, his ego, rotted away
under him&mdash;and to know that
he would wind up as a drooling
idiot....</p>

<p>He made his decision, almost
as quickly as he had come to realize
what Buehl must be.</p>

<p>There was a razor in the medicine
chest. It was a safety razor,
of course, but the blade was sharp
and it would be big enough.
There was no time for careful
planning. One of the guards
might come in at any moment if
they thought he was taking too
long.</p>

<p>Some fear came back as he
leaned over the wash basin, staring
at his throat, fingering the
suddenly murderous blade. But
the pain wouldn't last long&mdash;a
lot less than there would be under
shock treatment, and less pain.
He'd read enough to feel sure of
that.</p>

<p>Twice he braced himself and
failed at the last second. His
mind flashed out in wild schemes,
fighting against what it knew had
to be done.</p>

<p>The world still had to be
warned! If he could escape, somehow
... if he could still find a
way.... He couldn't quit, no
matter how impossible things
looked.</p>

<p>But he knew better. There was
nothing one man could do against
the aliens in this world they had
taken over. He'd never had a
chance. Man had been chained already
by carefully developed ridicule
against superstition, by carefully
indoctrinated gobbledegook
about insanity, persecution complexes,
and all the rest.</p>

<p>For a second, Dane even considered
the possibility that he
was insane. But he knew it was
only a blind effort to cling to life.
There had been no insanity in
him when he'd groped for evidence
in the coffin and found it
empty!</p>

<p>He leaned over the wash basin,
his eyes focused on his throat,
and his hand came down and
around, carrying the razor blade
through a lethal semicircle.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dane Phillips</span> watched fear
give place to sickness on his
face as the pain lanced through
him and the blood spurted.</p>

<p>He watched horror creep up to
replace the sickness while the
bleeding stopped and the gash
began closing.</p>

<p>By the time he recognized his
expression as the same one he'd
seen on his father's face at the
window so long ago, the wound
was completely healed.</p>
